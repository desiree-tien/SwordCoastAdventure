The Goblang King was thoroughly embarassed and enraged and ambushed Kellen's master in the woods. He then sent his entire horde to defeat Kellen and his village. While the master healed, Kellen trained a newly confident band of warrior farmers. The Goblang goblins were no match for the fair-haired blademaster and his agricultural army.</td>
