	    <h3>Session 0: January 14, 2018</h3>
            <p>We rolled our five daring adventurers: Erg, Kellen, River, Rufus, and Arken. 
		    For more information about each adventurer, visit the <a href="adventurers.html">Adventurers</a> page.</p>
            <br>
            <p>PCs found a way for each character to have a loose association with the others. Erg, Kellent, and Arken 
		arrived in the port of Daggerford on a ship in distress. River, the Water Genasi with the unique ability
		 to breathe water, towed their small ship into port. </p>
            <br>
            <p>We learned about Daggerford, it's ruling hierarchy (The Duke), and the surrounding areas. We learned about
	    the larger Sword Coast and the larger regions surrounding the coastline. This includes numerous forests, 
		mountain ranges, and even a big ol' desert.</p>
