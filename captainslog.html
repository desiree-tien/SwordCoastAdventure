      <h3>Session 2: February 25, 2018</h3>
      <p><b>Continuing up the tradeway...and back again....</b></p>

      <p>Skipping Floshin, Rufus uses tools in his bag to to make a telescope and sees a smudge like thing up ahead. Arken, Kellen and Gher head towards the smudge and find out that it is a swarm of insects.  Gher uses a gust cantrip to blow the swarm of insects away so that they can inspect that it was hovering over. And find out that it was a dead horse which died from stab wounds, and is suspected to belong to the Duke, as it has the Duke's colors</p>

      <p>As the group continues, they find another horse similiar to the first. They continye on and find a crashed cart, with an abandoned bag of wheat. It appears to be surrounded by goblin treads leading to and from the forest. Following some human tracks down the road we found a crashed carts and the other parts of the caravan pulled off to hide in the woods.</p>

      <p>During inital greeting, Arnaud shoots Mary, after Rufus continues forward towards the group-after being told to halt. Rufus tends to Mary, after a heated argument with Arnaud, one of the guards with the conoy. Osmar proves to the group that they've been working for the Duke and are here to help.</p>

      <p> A woman (Tulow) is salvaging boards to repair one of the other carts. In the traveling party there is a racist hick (Rol), another solider woman wearing the Duke's colors, and a very seriously injured man. Arken heals the wounded man, which impresses the racist hick. Arken also heals Mary, with remaining points of her spell. Nora, the solider woman who is the Duke's ranger, is impressed by Arken's power.</p>

      <p> The group finds out that the caravan was attacked by bandits and goblins at the same time. As well as 2 small creatures with dark red skin, that wielded wands that half way destroyed one of the carts. </p>

      <p>The group repairs the cart, and camps the night through. Then leave and head back to Daggerford. On the way back, River notices a patch of scorched earth. We invesigate but are unable to determine anything. During the evening we stop at the Screaming Fish Inn and Tavern. The group mingles with the bartend, but eventually everyone except Kellen and Arken sleep for the night.</p>

      <p>The next morning we depart and by mid afternoon we've made it back to Daggerford. Rufus and Arken go with Nora and Osmar to talk to the Duke about what has happened. The rest remain at the stables with the goods.</p>
      
      <p> <b>At the Duke's:</b> Osmar and Nora relay the story. Maltis will handle the delivery of the reward, and Joycee will take care of their stay at the Inn. Rufus asks to keep Mary, and lets the Duke know she was injuried and healed. He says he will consider it. The group rejoins the others at the stables.</p>

      <p> Kellen and River begin to open up boxes while Rufus sneaks into another cart and looks throught he goods in a chest. He picks a lock and discovers a chest full of books and scrolls. One of the scrolls is a corespondance between another wizard, Splonk. He is going on vacation and requests that Delphin look over the High Forest, a fairy forest. </p>

      <p>The party heads over to the wizard tower and Delphin invites them in. Rufus, Gher, and Kellen, remove their shoes. The room is a chaotic mess. Delphin assigns Kellen with returning a honey dipper to Joycee.  The group walks Delphin back ot the stables so that he can review his goods. Once determining that nothing of his was missing. He has the group carry the chests that belong to him back to his tower and put them in his room. He begins to remove the contents and place them on the ground near him. The chests consists of more scrolls and books. One of the itmes was a crystal snowflake which is a relic he takes upstairs to his bedroom. Delphin notes that one of the scrolls was tampered with but sends everyoen on their way to return tomorrow.</p>

      <p>Rufus, River, and Kellen go to the Shining Tavern, where the Duke has set them up for the week. Gher and Arken go to talk to the Duke, to once again confirm that there is important missing other than wheat and other goods. Upon arriving at the tavern Rufus gets a drink and goes to play cards and share tales of our adventure. River pets a giant dog sleeping by the fire.  Kellen delivers the honey dipper to Joycee. Satisfied with the completion of this quest Gher orders a beverage as well. Rufus sows rumors of Mary getting shot when it wasn't his fault. Stating that his intentions are good, and that he wants to take care of her. </p>

	    <h3>Session 0: January 14, 2018</h3>
            <p>We rolled our five daring adventurers: Erg, Kellen, River, Rufus, and Arken. 
		    For more information about each adventurer, visit the <a href="adventurers.html">Adventurers</a> page.</p>
            <br>
            <p>PCs found a way for each character to have a loose association with the others. Erg, Kellent, and Arken 
		arrived in the port of Daggerford on a ship in distress. River, the Water Genasi with the unique ability
		 to breathe water, towed their small ship into port. </p>
            <br>
            <p>We learned about Daggerford, it's ruling hierarchy (The Duke), and the surrounding areas. We learned about
	    the larger Sword Coast and the larger regions surrounding the coastline. This includes numerous forests, 
		mountain ranges, and even a big ol' desert.</p>
